# This is the celestial Bodies Database project on freecodecamp relational database certification
I had to create a database with 5 tables.
Each table should have primary key, 3 of them should have forein key
I should also use unique and not null constraint on multiple column
I had to insert 20 rows of data in one of them, 12 on another etc...
All of this qith pure SQl
