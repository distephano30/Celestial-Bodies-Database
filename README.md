# This is the celestial Bodies Database project on freecodecamp relational database certification
I had to create a database with 5 tables.

Each table should have primary key, 3 of them should have foreign key.

I also had to use unique and not null constraint on multiple column.

I had to insert 20 rows of data in one of them, 12 on another etc...

All of this with pure SQl.
